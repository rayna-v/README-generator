    ## Motivation
    This was my first dive into the back end. It was an opportunity to utilize NODE.js and the Inquirer packages to run command line prompts and write to a file. I wanted the README to be clean and functional for the user.

    ## How to Use
    To use, clone locally and run 'node index.js' in the terminal. Answer the questions as you would like them to appear in the README.

    ## Installation
    Clone or fork this repo
