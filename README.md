# README-Generator

## Motivation
This was my first opportunity to use Node.js and remote modules to create an application. I wanted to this to not only be intuitive for the user but also look like the high-quality READMEs that I am use to creating. The questions are direct and concise so the answers can seamlessly be used to dynamically create the markdown file. I wanted this to be an application that I will enjoy using for future repositories.

## How to Use
After installing/cloning locally, the user must run 'node index.js' in the terminal which will invoke a series of prompts. Users can simply answer the questions as he/she would like them to appear in the preformatted README. Once all questions have been answered, the README.md file is created and stored in the same-level directory.

## Installation
Currently, this app must be cloned to install locally.
