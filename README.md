# README-Generator

## Motivation
This was my first dive into the back end. It was an opportunity to utilize NODE.js and the Inquirer packages to run command line prompts and write to a file. I wanted the README to be clean and functional for the user.

## How to Use
To use, clone locally and run 'node index.js' in the terminal. Answer the questions as you would like them to appear in the README.
